Sync multiple adguard instances on a schedule for high-availability

# MAIN TAGS üè∑Ô∏è
These are the main tags for the image. There is also a tag for each commit and its shorthand sha256 value.

* [0.7.2](https://hub.docker.com/r/11notes/adguard-sync/tags?name=0.7.2)
* [stable](https://hub.docker.com/r/11notes/adguard-sync/tags?name=stable)
* [latest](https://hub.docker.com/r/11notes/adguard-sync/tags?name=latest)

![API](https://github.com/11notes/docker-adguard-sync/blob/master/img/API.png?raw=true)

# SYNOPSIS üìñ
**What can I do with this?** If you want to run [11notes/adguard](https://github.com/11notes/docker-adguard) high-available you need something to synchronize the settings between the two or more instances. [adguardhome-sync](https://github.com/bakito/adguardhome-sync) solves this issue by copying all settings from a master to infinite slaves.

# UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION üí∂
**Why should I run this image and not the other image(s) that already exist?** Good question! All the other images on the market that do exactly the same don‚Äôt do or offer these options:

> [!IMPORTANT]
>* This image runs as 1000:1000 by default, most other images run everything as root
>* This image has no shell since it is 100% distroless, most other images run on a distro like Debian or Alpine with full shell access (security)
>* This image does not ship with any critical or high rated CVE and is automatically maintained via CI/CD, most other images mostly have no CVE scanning or code quality tools in place
>* This image is created via a secure, pinned CI/CD process and immune to upstream attacks, most other images have upstream dependencies that can be exploited
>* This image contains a proper health check that verifies the app is actually working, most other images have either no health check or only check if a port is open or ping works
>* This image works as read-only, most other images need to write files to the image filesystem

If you value security, simplicity and the ability to interact with the maintainer and developer of an image. Using my images is a great start in that direction.

# PARENT IMAGE üèõÔ∏è
> [!IMPORTANT]
>This image is not based on another image but uses [scratch](https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch) as the starting layer.
>The image consists of the following distroless layers that were added:
>* [11notes/distroless](https://github.com/11notes/docker-distroless/blob/master/arch.dockerfile) - contains users, timezones and Root CA certificates
>* [11notes/distroless:curl](https://github.com/11notes/docker-distroless/blob/master/curl.dockerfile) - app to execute HTTP or UNIX requests

# BUILT WITH üß∞
* [adguardhome-sync](https://github.com/bakito/adguardhome-sync)

# GENERAL TIPS üìå
> [!TIP]
>* Use a reverse proxy like Traefik, Nginx, HAproxy to terminate TLS and to protect your endpoints
>* Use Let‚Äôs Encrypt DNS-01 challenge to obtain valid SSL certificates for your services

# CAUTION ‚ö†Ô∏è
> [!CAUTION]
>* This image comes with a default SSL certificate. If you plan to expose the web interface via HTTPS, please replace the default certificate with your own or use a reverse proxy
>* This image comes with a default configuration with a default password for the admin account. Please set your own password or provide your own configuration.
